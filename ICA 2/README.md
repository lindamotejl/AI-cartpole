# AI-cartpole
This project uses reinforcement learning in order to sole the Cart-Pole enviroment provided by Open AI Gym. 

# Methodologies used
Q-Learning and the E-Greedy exploration will be compared to eachother when solving the problem

# What's included
1. README.md
2. Implementation of prototype including both implementation including for:<br />
    Q-Learning <br />
    E-Greedy Strategy.
3. Research Paper titled " Comparing Q-Learning with Epsilon GreedyExploration on the Cart-Pole Problem"
A introduction to reinforcement learning is included, a presentation of the Cart-Pole problem, and a in-depth analysis of the results.


# How to run
This prototype was made on Jupyter notebook , and it is recommended to run the files on a Jupyter notebook.
